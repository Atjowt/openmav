# OpenMaverick

## Cloning and working with Git
1. To begin, clone the repository using `git clone <URL>`. If you are using HTTPS this would look like `git clone https://github.com/Atjowt/openmav.git`.
2. Whenever you want to make some changes on your local machine, start by doing a `git pull --rebase` to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts later down the line.
3. Make sure to provide a reasonable commit message for your changes, see `git log` for a history of previous commits.
4. When you are done making your changes, first verify that nothing is seriously broken, and then push your changes with `git push`.
